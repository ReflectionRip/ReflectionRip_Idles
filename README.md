# ReflectionRip_Idles
CoQ idles that can be added to make NPC's/Creatures more interesting.

This currently adds the following idles:
* Campfire - Creatures idle around campfires.
* Guard Spot - Creatures idle at a spot on the map.

This also adds owned bedrolls that are more like beds. They cannot be taken, and are owned by a Creature/NPC or a Faction.  

The new campfire idle, and guard spot idles also add owner/faction settings.

Currently adds the following to Joppa:
* 1 Idle Campfire belonging to the Joppa Faction.
* Many bedrolls belonging to NPC's and Watervine Farmers.
* Many Guard Spots belonging to Watervine Farmers.

All these items make Joppa a more active location.  I will think about adding some idle objects to other locations later.
